README file for the jkarel directory

-----------------------------------------------------
This directory rebuilds the karel.jar archive used to
implement the Java-based version of Karel the Robot.

To rebuild the karel.jar file from the command line on
Mac OS X or a Unix-based system, just type

    make all

The Makefile always recompiles all the source files and
doesn't try to be clever about dependencies, which is
relatively difficult for Java packages.

The jkarel directory includes a copy of acm.jar, which is
needed for the compilation process.  If you check out this
package, you should check to see whether there is a new
version of acm.jar and update it to the most recent version.
The contents of the acm.jar file are merged into karel.jar
so that students can work with only a single jar file.
